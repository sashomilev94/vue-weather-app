# Vue Weather App 🌦️

- A simple weather forecast app built with **Vue 3** + **Vite** + **TailwindCSS**, using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/).

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) with `<script setup>`
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast builds
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for API calls

## 🛠️ Setup
- git clone <your-repo-url>
- cd vue-weather-app
- npm install
- Create a .env file in the project root
	Add your API key as following ( "VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key_here" ) // Important NOTE - your key must start with VITE_ because otherwise it is not recognised by vite.
- npm run dev
